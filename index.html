    <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
    <div> 
        <p>
        In a blender, blend together the water, instant coffee, eggs, oil, sugar, and cocoa powder until smooth. 
        Transfer to a bowl, add the flour and baking powder, and mix with a spoon. 
        Pour the batter into cupcake liners placed in a muffin tin, arranging them side by side.  
        Bake in a preheated medium oven for about 25 minutes, or until baked through and golden. Remove and let cool. 
        <br><br>
        For the filling, cook all the ingredients over medium heat, stirring well until thickened. Turn off the heat, let cool, and transfer to a piping bag with a round tip. Set aside. Place the whipped cream into another piping bag fitted with a star tip and set aside.  
        <br>
        <br>
        To assemble, make a hole in the center of each cupcake and fill with the reserved coffee brigadeiro. Decorate the tops with the whipped cream, piping in circles. Garnish with coffee beans and refrigerate until ready to serve.
